                       TcosMonitor
               (mariodebian AT gmail DOT com)

  TcosMonitor is a pygtk app to control and supervise
  a thin client classroom based on TCOS, PXES, LTSP or others.


  The project have 2 different parts:

   * Teacher Tool (TcosMonitor) made with pygtk and other
     standar libs

   * Thin Client daemon (tcosxmlrpc) developed in C based on
     xmlrpc libs and abyss web server code and libs. 
     For debug output exec TCOS_DEBUG=1 /usr/bin/tcosxmlrpc /etc/abys.conf

   * Some extra tools (hex2ascii, update-tcospasswd, etc...)


  The initial code is written from scratch helped with pygtk
  tutorial [1] and some web pages (blogs, maillist, etc...)

  I have reutilized some python/C code from others:
  
    ping.py
       High based on yetist [2], I have added a second
       class named PingPort writen by me. 
         (don't know license of it, japanesse page)
  
    TcosDbus.py class
        Based on dbus bindings of Student-Control-Center of Ubuntu [3]
