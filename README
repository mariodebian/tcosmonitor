                       TcosMonitor
               (mariodebian AT gmail DOT com)

  TcosMonitor is a pygtk app to control and supervise
  a thin client classroom based on TCOS, PXES, LTSP or others.


  The project have 2 different parts:

   * Teacher Tool (TcosMonitor) made with pygtk and other
     standar libs

   * Thin Client daemon (tcosxmlrpc) developed in C based on
     xmlrpc libs and abyss web server code and libs

   * Some extra tools (hex2ascii, update-tcospasswd, etc...)


  The initial code is written from scratch helped with pygtk
  tutorial [1] and some web pages (blogs, maillist, etc...)

  I have reutilized some python/C code from others:
  
    ping.py
       High based on yetist [2], I have added a second
       class named PingPort writen by me. 
         (don't know license of it, japanesse page)
  
    xmlrpc/hex2ascii.c 
       Based on http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2073
       this is a small tool to convert an HEX string into ASCII
       used by TCOS thin client when DHCP server is configured
       with no static MAC.
        (web says:
          "Snippets is a public source code repository."
            I suppose that I can use without problems )
