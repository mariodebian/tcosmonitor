  Some parts are based on other works:
    ping.py
       High based on yetist [1], I have added a second
       class named PingPort writen by me.
         (don't know license of it, japanesse page)

    xmlrpc/hex2ascii.c
       Based on http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2073
       this is a small tool to convert an HEX string into ASCII
       used by TCOS thin client when DHCP server is configured
       with no static MAC.
        (web says:
          "Snippets is a public source code repository."
            I suppose that I can use without problems )


    TcosDbus.py class
        Based on dbus bindings of Student-Control-Center of Ubuntu [2]
